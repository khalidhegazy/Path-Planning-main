# Path-Planning

On a grid starting from (0,0) to (1000,1000) a robot that is represented as a single point is placed at (10,10) with angle 0 degrees and is trying to reach (950,950) with angle 90 degrees

The robot is unable to move except in steps of 10.
Created a graph search algorithm to find and created a path from point A to point B for the robot that respects the kinematic model and avoids collision with the obstacles using A*.
